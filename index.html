        <h4><a href="#">Lemons</a></h4>
        <p>High in vitamin C, lemons and their lime green counterparts are fairly sour fruits.</p>
        <p>They don’t contain much sugar and are the perfect addition to a glass of water to help curb your appetite.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h4><a href="#">Raspberries</a></h4>
        <p>With only five grams — a bit more than a teaspoon — of sugar per cup, and lots of fiber to help fill you up, raspberries are one of several amazing berries to make the list.</p>

      <img class="cards-img" src="images/straw.jpg" alt="strawberries">
      <div class="content">
        <h4><a href="#">Strawberries</a></h4>
        <p>Strawberries are surprisingly low in sugar considering they taste so sweet and delicious.</p>
        <p>One cup of raw strawberries has about seven grams of sugar, along with over 100 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C.</p>

        <h4><a href="#">Blackberries</a></h4>
        <p>Blackberries also only have seven grams of sugar per cup.</p>
        <p>You don’t have to feel guilty snacking on these dark colored berries.</p>
        <p>As a bonus, they’re also high in antioxidants as well as fiber.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h4><a href="#">Kiwis</a></h4>
        <p>These odd fuzzy green-fleshed fruits are technically considered a berry too.</p>
        <p>Kiwis (or kiwifruits) are rich in vitamin C and low in sugar — with just six grams per kiwi.</p>
        <p>You can find kiwis all year-round at the grocery store.</p>

        <h4><a href="#">Grapes</a></h4>
        <p>Another citrus fruit to make the list is grapefruit.</p>
        <p>While grapefruits certainly don’t taste as sweet as a grape, they make for a great breakfast with only nine grams of sugar in half of a medium-sized grapefruit.</p>

    <section class="cards">
      <img class="cards-img" src="images/avacado.jpg" alt="avacado">
      <div class="content">
        <h4><a href="#">Avacado</a></h4>
        <p>While not exactly the first thing that comes to mind when you think of fruit, avocados are indeed fruits, and naturally low in sugar. </p>
        <p>An entire raw avocado only has about one gram of sugar.</p>
        <p>What avocados do have a lot of are healthy fats, which will help keep you satiated.</p>

      <img class="cards-img" src="images/water.jpg" alt="watermelon">
      <div class="content">
        <h4><a href="#">Watermelon</a></h4>
        <p>Watermelons are the iconic summer fruit.</p>
        <p>They may seem like a treat, but they’re low in sugar.</p>
        <p>A whole cup of diced up watermelon has under 10 grams of sugar.</p>
        <p>A bonus of eating watermelon is it’s also a great source of iron.</p>

      <img class="cards-img" src="images/oranges.jpg" alt="oranges">
      <div class="content">
        <h4><a href="#">Oranges</a></h4>
        <p>Oranges are another great way to enjoy a sweet snack without all the calories and sugar, while also boosting your Vitamin C intake.</p>
        <p>A typical naval orange has about 12 grams of sugar per fruit and less than 70 calories.</p>
